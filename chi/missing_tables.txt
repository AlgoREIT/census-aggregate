Out of curiosity, I generated a list of tables which are in the general ACS 2012-5 year release, but for which no data was available at the Chicago tract level. 65 of those tables are specific to Puerto Rico. 108 are not, and those are listed below.

Four other tables were generated by this process but probably shouldn't have been, since the universe for them is people living either in a Micropolitan statistical area or not living in any CBSA -- neither of which is possible for Chicago residents.
